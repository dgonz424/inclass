** HINT ** As a best practice, sketch the architecture of your application before you start writing code.

node CLI.js (2/admin or something else) (3/username, but if admin, done) (4/location) 

Instructions:  For this exercise, start by describing what your application does. Do this in a bullet list.
1. runs node, runs file
2. [2] is to enter admin or something else, like user
3. [3] is to give username unless process.argv[2]===admin
4. [4] is to give location, which will return weather info (possibly npm install weather-js)

- Next, decide how you might divvy up these responsibilities
	-- Would you write a single module that handles all of them?
	-- Would you write one module for each bullet list?
	-- Something else?
	-- Be sure to justify your decision.
- Finally, draw a diagram describing the relationships between your modules
	-- Each arrow should describe a dependencyâ€”that is, an arrow from module A to module B indicates that
		 module A uses module B.
